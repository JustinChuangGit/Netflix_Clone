## Project Description 
This undertaking was initiated to gain practical knowledge of Javascript and the React framework. Given my strong interest in movies, it seemed appropriate to create a clone of Netflix.
## Results
Driven by a strong desire to enhance my expertise in Javascript and React, I successfully transfered my knowledge from Dart and Flutter to create a functional Netflix clone. This application dynamically updates its movie wallpaper with each refresh, and upon clicking a movie title, it plays the corresponding trailer rather than the entire movie.
